# Trading Bot
 
## Setup Instructions
 
This bot is built for AI-enhanced trading with PostgreSQL for storing market data and Discord webhooks for trade notifications.
 
### Prerequisites
- macOS with Homebrew installed
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3 (comes with macOS)
- Git
- Discord webhook URL
### Step 1: Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tradingBot.git
cd tradingBot
```
 
### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
 
### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
### Step 4: Create a `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Discord webhook and DB credentials:
```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
DB_PASS=your_database_password
```
 
### Step 5: Start PostgreSQL with Docker Compose
Ensure you have Docker running, then spin up the DB:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
 
### Step 6: Load the Schema
Your schema file should be mapped in `docker-compose.yml`. It will be executed on first DB boot.
 
Example schema for tickers:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tickers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```
 
### Step 7: Run the Bot
With your virtual environment activated:
```bash
python main.py
```
 
### Step 8: Monitor CLI & Discord
The bot logs actions to the CLI and sends notifications to your Discord server.

üí° You can use `cron` or `launchd` to schedule the bot to run between market hours (9:30AM ‚Äì 4:00PM EST).
 
Happy trading üöÄ

## üî• Bot Summary (For the Homies)

This ain‚Äôt your grandpa‚Äôs stock bot. This is a machine-learning-powered, Discord-notifying, PostgreSQL-storing, ultra-slick auto-trader built with love, caffeine, and a little bit of market revenge.

What it does:
- Pulls candles faster than John Wick reloads
- Calculates indicators like a trading Jedi
- Makes real-time decisions (buy/hold/sell) ‚Äî all without blinking
- Learns from its mistakes and comes back stronger
- Sends you Discord updates so you look like a Wall Street wizard while walking your dog

Future plans:
- Confidence scoring? Yup.
- Ensemble models with voting logic? Already in the works.
- Real-time fire trades that print green candles all day? You bet your last contract.

Let‚Äôs build the beast, feed it data, train it up, and let it feast on the market. The game plan is strong, the hustle is real, and the tech is bulletproof (or at least cronproof).

Welcome to the grind. Let‚Äôs make some damn money üí∞üöÄ
